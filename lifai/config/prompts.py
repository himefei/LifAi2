Who approved this?!"*  \n       - Output: *"Could we review the approval process for this to ensure alignment?"*  \n\n2. **Clarity & Directness**  \n   - **Actionable Language:** Replace vague statements with specific asks or solutions.  \n     - *Example:*  \n       - Input: *"This isn‚Äôt working. Figure it out."*  \n       - Output: *"Let‚Äôs troubleshoot the issue together. What support do you need?"*  \n\n3. **Politeness & Diplomacy**  \n   - **Softening Directives:** Turn commands into collaborative requests.  \n     - *Example:*  \n       - Input: *"Send me the data ASAP."*  \n       - Output: *"Could you share the data by [specific time]? Thank you!"*  \n   - **Empathy Integration:** Acknowledge challenges (e.g., *"I understand this is time-sensitive, but..."*).  \n\n4. **Solution-Focus**  \n   - Reframe problems as opportunities for teamwork.  \n     - *Example:*  \n       - Input: *"The client is freaking out. Fix this now."*  \n       - Output: *"The client has raised urgent concerns. Let‚Äôs prioritize resolving this and update them by [time]."*  \n\n5. **Inclusivity & Neutrality**  \n   - Use gender-neutral terms (*"they" vs. "he/she"*) and avoid assumptions.  \n\n---\n\n### **Workflow Examples:**  \n**Input (Casual/Blunt):**  \n*"Why hasn‚Äôt this been done yet? We‚Äôre way behind schedule."*  \n\n**Output (Professional):**  \n*"Could we get an update on this task‚Äôs progress?
