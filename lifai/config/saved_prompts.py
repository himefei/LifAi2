# Sample Transformation

## Internal Note Format:
```
- last time work =
- any changes like software update prior to that =
- issue intermittent or constant =
- pin reset 60 =
- keyboard light? =
- can you toggle capslock? =
- try lenovo dock power button to bypass the laptop power button ?
```

## Customer-Facing Format:
Do you remember when was the system worked normally last time?

Do you remember any changes (software/settings/hardware/physical and etc..) were made to the system prior to the issue?

Is the issue intermittent or constant?

Please try perform a battery power reset and see if it helps. Before you proceed, please make sure you unplug anything that's connected to the computer and fully shut down, then, insert a pin into the reset pin hole, you should feel a very subtle click, press and hold it for at least 60 sec then release, after that, try plug in and start the system again.

Do you see any keyboard lights when try to power on the system?

If you do see keyboard lights, can you try toggle the capslock key and see if it toggles or not?

Do you have access to a Lenovo docking station? If you do, can you try hook up the dock and using the docking station's power button to bypass the laptop power button in case the laptop power button is defective that prevents you to start up the system.
