# 🪄 LifAi2 is an Local LLM powered (Ollama and LM Studio) Python App

### A hub to invoke a flocating toolbar to enhance text with RAG support

### Now added Chain of Thoughts filtering function, so DeepSeek Ri1 model and its distilled models can work better when replacing/enhancing text (I think anything about DeepSeek is big enough to deserve a headline LOL)

## 🚀 Welcome!

Hey there! 👋 I'm not a professional programmer, but with some high school coding experience and a lot of enthusiasm, I'm diving into the world of GitHub to build something awesome with AI.

Inspired by powerful AI tools like **Claude Dev** and **Cursor**, I've created lightweight apps and Chrome extensions. Now, I'm taking on a bigger challenge: a Python app powered by [OLLAMA](https://ollama.ai/) and [LM Studio](https://https://lmstudio.ai/) for:

- ✍️ **Writing Improvement**: Enhance text with custom prompts
- ✏️ **Prompt Editor**: Craft and refine your AI prompts with customizations
- 🚀 **RAG**: Built-in RAG support for knowledge
