## 🚀 Welcome!

Hey there! 👋 I'm not a professional programmer, but with some high school coding experience and a lot of enthusiasm, I'm diving into the world of GitHub to build something awesome with AI.

Inspired by powerful AI tools like **Claude Dev** and **Cursor**, I've created lightweight apps and Chrome extensions. Now, I'm taking on a bigger challenge: a Python app powered by [OLLAMA](https://ollama.ai/) and [LM Studio](https://https://lmstudio.ai/) for:

- ✍️ **Writing Improvement**: Enhance text with custom prompts
- ✏️ **Prompt Editor**: Craft and refine your AI prompts with customizations
- 🚀 **RAG**: Built-in RAG support for knowledge

## 🎯 Why This Project?

AI coding assistants have opened up amazing possibilities for tech enthusiasts like me. This project is all about learning, experimenting, and seeing what we can create together with AI help.

## 🤝 Contribute

This is a personal learning journey, and I'm still getting the hang of GitHub. But I'm open to ideas and collaborations! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## 🙏 Thanks
