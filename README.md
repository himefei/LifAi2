# OLLAMA-Powered Python App for Spell Checking, Writing Improvement, and Translation

## Introduction

Welcome to my project!

**I'm not a programmer**, but I have some basic understanding of programming and coding from classes I took back in high school. Recently, I've been amazed by how powerful and helpful AI coding assistants have become. With the help of tools like **Claude Dev** and **Cursor**, I've successfully created several lightweight and life-hack apps and Chrome extensions tailored to my very specific needs. I was truly impressed by their capabilities.

Now, I'm excited to embark on a journey to tackle a **bigger and more complicated project**. This repository is both an exploration and a testament to the capabilities of AI coding assistants.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a Python application that leverages [OLLAMA](https://ollama.ai/) to run local Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks such as:

- **Spell Checking**: Detect and correct spelling errors in text.
- **Writing Improvement**: Suggest enhancements to improve clarity, style, and readability.
- **Translation**: Translate text between multiple languages.

I don't have a fixed end goal in mind; instead, this project is more about the journey and experimentation with AI coding assistance.

## Motivation

The rapid advancements in AI coding assistance have opened up new possibilities for people like me, who aren't professional programmers but have a keen interest in technology. By using tools like **Claude Dev** and **Cursor**, I'm able to bring my ideas to life and solve problems in unique ways. Their capabilities have truly amazed me.

This project is my way of exploring the potential of AI-assisted coding and pushing the boundaries of what I can create.

## Project Goals

- **Learning Experience**: Deepen my understanding of Python programming and AI integration.
- **Leverage AI Tools**: Utilize AI coding assistants like Claude Dev and Cursor to overcome challenges and implement complex features.
- **Community Engagement**: Share my progress and learn from others in the developer community.

## Features (Planned)

- **to work universally in a PC with writing assist**
- **call agent to perform specific task**

## Getting Started

*Instructions on how to install and set up the project will be added as development progresses.*

## Roadmap

1. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Install Python and necessary dependencies.
   - Configure OLLAMA for local LLM usage.

2. **Implement Core Features**
   - Spell checking functionality.
   - Writing improvement suggestions.
   - Translation capabilities.

3. **Develop User Interface**
   - Design a simple GUI or command-line interface.
   - Integrate user input and display outputs effectively.

4. **Testing and Refinement**
   - Test features extensively.
   - Refine based on feedback and performance.

5. **Documentation**
   - Write clear documentation and usage guides.
   - Provide examples and tutorials.
