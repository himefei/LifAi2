## Major Project Refactoring (2025-05-15)

Completed a comprehensive project-wide refactoring focusing on performance, modernization, compliance, and bug fixes.

**Key Changes:**
- Implemented asynchronous programming (`async/await`, Python 3.9+) for I/O-bound operations, significantly improving performance.
- Overhauled the prompt editor: switched to JSON-based storage ([`prompts.json`](lifai/modules/prompt_editor/prompts.json)) with UUIDs, and addressed critical bugs.
- Introduced new libraries: `httpx` for HTTP clients and `aiofiles` for async file I/O.
- Updated AI clients, knowledge base, and UI components for better performance and modern practices.
- Ensured compliance with project coding standards and updated all code comments and the main [`README.md`](README.md).
- Previous module cleanup (AI Chat, Advanced Agent) integrated into the overall modernized structure.
