## Major Project Refactoring (2025-05-15)

Completed a comprehensive project-wide refactoring focusing on performance, modernization, compliance, and bug fixes.

**Key Changes:**
- Implemented asynchronous programming (`async/await`, Python 3.9+) for I/O-bound operations, significantly improving performance.
- Overhauled the prompt editor: switched to JSON-based storage ([`prompts.json`](lifai/modules/prompt_editor/prompts.json)) with UUIDs, and addressed critical bugs.
- Introduced new libraries: `httpx` for HTTP clients and `aiofiles` for async file I/O.
- Updated AI clients, knowledge base, and UI components for better performance and modern practices.
- Ensured compliance with project coding standards and updated all code comments and the main [`README.md`](README.md).
- Previous module cleanup (AI Chat, Advanced Agent) integrated into the overall modernized structure.

## AI Client Modernization Initiative (2025-06-25)

**Current Focus:** Successfully completed major enhancement of LM Studio and Ollama clients using latest context7 documentation to integrate cutting-edge API features.

**Key Accomplishments:**
- Researched and integrated LM Studio's latest native REST API capabilities
- Migrated Ollama client to use new `/api/embed` endpoint and enhanced features
- Added TTL support for automatic model resource management
- Implemented structured output support with JSON schemas
- Enhanced performance monitoring and error handling across both clients
- Maintained backward compatibility while adding modern features

**Technical Improvements:**
- LM Studio: Dual API support (native + OpenAI-compatible)
- Ollama: Latest embedding endpoints with batch processing
- Both: Enhanced streaming, better error recovery, comprehensive metrics
- Architecture: Consistent response structures and async-first design

**Next Considerations:**
- Monitor client performance in production
- Consider integrating LM Studio's native Python SDK for even more features
- Evaluate additional Ollama capabilities like model management automation

## User Experience Enhancement (2025-06-25)

**New Feature:** Added interactive prompt flow illustration accessible via question mark button next to backend selection.

**Implementation Details:**
- Question mark help button styled with blue background (#2196F3) 
- Dynamic content based on selected backend (Ollama vs LM Studio)
- Rich HTML formatting with visual flow diagrams
- Explains system prompt setup, user text processing, and API communication
- Shows actual endpoint URLs and message flow

**IMPORTANT MAINTENANCE NOTE:**
ðŸ”„ **Future Update Requirement:** When making changes to prompt processing, API endpoints, or message flow in either LM Studio or Ollama clients, the help dialog content in `lifai/core/app_hub.py` method `show_prompt_flow_help()` must be updated accordingly to maintain accuracy.

**Key Areas to Monitor for Updates:**
- API endpoint changes (URLs, parameters)
- Message structure modifications 
- New features in prompt processing
- Changes to system/user message handling
- Performance enhancements or new capabilities


[2025-01-07 15:14:00] - Completed reasoning token modernization: Successfully updated LifAi2 to use native reasoning token support from both Ollama and LM Studio instead of legacy regex filtering. The implementation now:
- Uses Ollama's native 'think' parameter and 'thinking' response field
- Prepares for LM Studio's upcoming native thinking support
- Maintains backward compatibility with legacy filtering as fallback
- Automatically detects when native thinking tokens are available
- Improves performance by avoiding post-processing regex operations


[2025-08-25 22:33:00] - Context7-Driven AI Client Modernization Completed: Successfully integrated latest findings from Context7 documentation to optimize both Ollama and LM Studio clients for maximum inference speed and enhanced performance monitoring.

**Current Focus:** AI client performance optimization and Context7 integration
- Ollama: Migrated to `/api/embed` endpoint, enhanced error handling, comprehensive performance metrics
- LM Studio: Native API v0 optimization, detailed model state tracking, advanced statistics integration
- Performance: Enhanced logging, speed validation, quality analysis, resource management

**Recent Changes:**
- Updated Ollama client to use latest `/api/embed` endpoint replacing deprecated `/api/embeddings`
- Enhanced LM Studio client to prioritize native API v0 for optimal performance and rich metadata
- Implemented comprehensive error handling with specific error types and recovery strategies
- Added detailed performance monitoring with tokens/second, time to first token, and generation metrics
- Enhanced model management with state tracking, architecture details, and quantization information

**Open Questions/Issues:**
- Monitor real-world performance improvements with the native API v0 optimizations
- Consider implementing additional Context7 features like structured output and function calling
- Evaluate potential for batch processing optimizations in production workloads
- Assess need for adaptive timeout strategies based on model complexity
