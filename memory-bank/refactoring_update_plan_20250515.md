# Memory Bank Update Plan (2025-05-15)

This document outlines the plan to update the files within the `memory-bank/` directory to reflect the significant refactoring changes made to the LifAi project.

## Phase 1: Information Gathering (Completed)

1.  **Reviewed Existing Documentation:**
    *   [`memory-bank/activeContext.md`](memory-bank/activeContext.md)
    *   [`memory-bank/productContext.md`](memory-bank/productContext.md)
    *   [`memory-bank/progress.md`](memory-bank/progress.md)
    *   [`memory-bank/projectbrief.md`](memory-bank/projectbrief.md)
    *   [`memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`](memory-bank/systemPatterns.md)
    *   [`memory-bank/techContext.md`](memory-bank/techContext.md)
2.  **Identified Key Changes to Document:**
    *   Adoption of `async/await` (Python 3.9+).
    *   New JSON-based prompt storage with UUIDs in the prompt editor.
    *   Introduction of new libraries: `httpx` (for all AI client HTTP calls) and `aiofiles` (for async file I/O, e.g., knowledge base, logging).
    *   Changes in module interactions and core component responsibilities.
    *   Reinforcement of modular Python, plugin-style organization, and separation of concerns.
    *   Improved performance and responsiveness.
    *   More reliable prompt editing.
    *   Removal of "AI Chat" and "Advanced Agent capabilities" modules.
    *   Summary of refactoring completion and current project status.

## Phase 2: Detailed Updates for Each File

### 1. `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`

*   **Architecture:**
    *   Reinforce "Modular Python application," "Core framework with plugin-style modules," and "Clear separation between core, modules, utils."
*   **Key Technical Decisions:**
    *   Add: "Adoption of asynchronous programming (`async/await`) for I/O-bound operations (network calls, file access) leveraging Python 3.9+ features."
    *   Add: "JSON-based prompt storage mechanism using UUIDs for identification in the prompt editor."
*   **Design Patterns:**
    *   Add: "Increased use of asynchronous patterns throughout I/O-bound operations."
    *   Review and update existing patterns if refactoring impacted them (e.g., Facade for AI clients might now involve `httpx`).
*   **Component Relationships:**
    *   Update to reflect any changes in how modules interact or how core components manage them, especially considering async operations.
*   **Mermaid Diagram:**
    *   Include a sequence diagram illustrating an example `async/await` flow for an I/O operation (e.g., an AI client call using `httpx`).
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant UserAction
        participant Module
        participant AI_Client
        participant ExternalAPI
    
        UserAction->>Module: Perform AI Task
        Module->>AI_Client: make_async_request(prompt)
        AI_Client->>ExternalAPI: ASYNC HTTP POST (httpx)
        ExternalAPI-->>AI_Client: ASYNC Response
        AI_Client-->>Module: Processed Result
        Module-->>UserAction: Display Result
    end
    ```

### 2. `memory-bank/techContext.md`

*   **Core Technologies:**
    *   Update Python version: "Python (primary implementation language, **now leveraging 3.9+ features for `asyncio`**)."
    *   Add: "`httpx` (for asynchronous HTTP requests to AI backends and other services)."
    *   Add: "`aiofiles` (for asynchronous file operations)."
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   Add: "`httpx` library."
    *   Add: "`aiofiles` library."
    *   Update UI framework if more clarity was gained during refactoring (still "Likely PyQt/PySide" unless confirmed otherwise).
*   **Data Formats (New Section or Add to Existing):**
    *   Add: "Prompt Storage: Prompts are now stored in a JSON format ([`prompts.json`](lifai/modules/prompt_editor/prompts.json)), with each prompt identified by a UUID."
*   **Development Setup:**
    *   Mention reliance on Python 3.9+ if specific features are critical.

### 3. `memory-bank/productContext.md`

*   **Purpose:**
    *   Review and ensure it still accurately reflects the product's goals post-refactoring.
    *   Line 8: "Offers modular UI components" - still valid.
*   **Problems Solved:**
    *   Line 12: "Static prompts - enables dynamic prompt editing" - reinforce with "more reliable and robust prompt editing."
*   **User Experience Goals:**
    *   Add: "Improved application performance and responsiveness due to asynchronous operations."
    *   Update: "Easy prompt customization" to "Reliable and intuitive prompt customization with persistent storage."
*   **Impact of Removed Modules:**
    *   Briefly note if the removal of "AI Chat" or "Advanced Agent" has streamlined or focused the product's core offerings, if applicable. For example: "Streamlined focus on core assistant capabilities and robust prompt management."

### 4. `memory-bank/activeContext.md`

*   **Replace existing content with a new entry:**
    *   Heading: `## Major Project Refactoring (2025-05-15)`
    *   Summary: "Completed a comprehensive project-wide refactoring focusing on performance, modernization, compliance, and bug fixes."
    *   Key Changes:
        *   "Implemented asynchronous programming (`async/await`, Python 3.9+) for I/O-bound operations, significantly improving performance."
        *   "Overhauled the prompt editor: switched to JSON-based storage ([`prompts.json`](lifai/modules/prompt_editor/prompts.json)) with UUIDs, and addressed critical bugs."
        *   "Introduced new libraries: `httpx` for HTTP clients and `aiofiles` for async file I/O."
        *   "Updated AI clients, knowledge base, and UI components for better performance and modern practices."
        *   "Ensured compliance with project coding standards and updated all code comments and the main [`README.md`](README.md)."
        *   "Previous module cleanup (AI Chat, Advanced Agent) integrated into the overall modernized structure."

### 5. `memory-bank/progress.md`

*   **Replace existing content with a new entry:**
    *   Heading: `## Project Status Post-Refactoring (2025-05-15)`
    *   Overall Status: "The LifAi project has undergone a significant refactoring. All core components have been updated for performance, modernization, and stability."
    *   **Prompt Editor:** "Fully refactored with JSON storage and UUIDs; bugs addressed."
    *   **AI Clients:** "Modernized with `async/await` and `httpx`."
    *   **Knowledge Base:** "Optimized, potentially using `aiofiles` for async operations."
    *   **UI Components:** "Reviewed and updated for performance."
    *   **Documentation:** "Code comments and [`README.md`](README.md) are up-to-date. Memory bank update is the current task."
    *   **Removed Modules:** "The previously removed modules (AI Chat, Advanced Agent) remain deprecated, with their functionalities either superseded or integrated into the refactored system where appropriate."

### 6. `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`

*   **Overview:**
    *   Remove "AI Chat" from the list of modules.
    *   Remove "Advanced Agent capabilities" from the list of modules.
    *   Ensure the remaining modules listed are accurate.
*   **Core Goals:**
    *   Review to ensure they align with the refactored project's capabilities.
    *   "Enable prompt editing and management" - still a core goal, now more robust.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   "Customizable prompts" - still a key feature.
    *   Remove features related to the removed modules if they were distinct.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Ensure this accurately reflects the current project components.

## Phase 3: User Review & Confirmation (Completed)
