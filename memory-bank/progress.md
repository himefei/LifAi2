## Project Status Post-Refactoring (2025-05-15)

The LifAi project has undergone a significant refactoring. All core components have been updated for performance, modernization, and stability.

- **Prompt Editor:** Fully refactored with JSON storage and UUIDs; bugs addressed.
- **AI Clients:** Modernized with `async/await` and `httpx`.
- **Knowledge Base:** Optimized, potentially using `aiofiles` for async operations.
- **UI Components:** Reviewed and updated for performance.
- **Documentation:** Code comments and [`README.md`](README.md) are up-to-date. Memory bank update is the current task.
- **Removed Modules:** The previously removed modules (AI Chat, Advanced Agent) remain deprecated, with their functionalities either superseded or integrated into the refactored system where appropriate.

[2025-06-25 11:24:00] - Added user-specific configuration files to .gitignore: app_settings.json and prompts.json to prevent committing user preferences and custom prompts.

[2025-06-25 11:42:00] - Major AI client refactoring completed: Enhanced LM Studio and Ollama clients with latest API features including TTL support, new embedding endpoints, improved streaming, better model management, and comprehensive error handling.

[2025-06-25 12:40:00] - Added user-friendly prompt flow illustration feature: Question mark help button next to backend selection that explains how system prompts and user text are processed for both Ollama and LM Studio with visual flow diagrams.

[2025-06-25 12:42:00] - Fixed async initialization error in OllamaClient: Removed asyncio.create_task() from __init__ method to prevent "no running event loop" runtime error during application startup.

[2025-06-25 12:53:00] - Optimized LM Studio client for native API v0: Switched default to /api/v0/ endpoints, added default TTL (600s), enhanced performance tracking with detailed metrics, and updated help dialog to highlight native API benefits.

[2025-06-25 13:58:00] - Fixed UI display issues in help dialog: Centered question mark button text with proper padding/margins, and completely redesigned help dialog using custom QDialog instead of QMessageBox to eliminate spacing gaps and provide better layout control with clean, professional appearance.


[2025-06-26 16:38:00] - Fixed Git tracking issue: Removed app_settings.json and prompts.json from Git tracking using 'git rm --cached' command. These files were already in .gitignore but continued showing in VSCode changes because they were previously tracked. Files are now properly ignored.


[2025-06-26 16:41:00] - Enhanced prompt backup system: Implemented automatic backup rotation in prompt editor that maintains only the 5 most recent backup files (.bak). Added _cleanup_old_backups() method to automatically remove older backups when saving, preventing unlimited accumulation of backup files.


[2025-06-26 16:48:00] - Major code refactoring completed: Refactored both prompt editor and floating toolbar modules for best practices and improved maintainability. Key improvements include:

**Prompt Editor Refactoring:**
- Separated concerns into dedicated classes: PromptStorageManager, PromptValidator, EmojiManager
- Added dataclasses and type hints throughout
- Improved error handling and validation
- Better code organization with private methods
- Constants extracted to module level
- Enhanced backup rotation system integration

**Floating Toolbar Refactoring:**
- Implemented proper separation of concerns with dedicated managers: PromptManager, ColorManager, TextFilter, MouseSelectionHandler
- Added enum for processing states and dataclass for UI styles
- Improved type hints and error handling throughout
- Better architecture with composition over inheritance
- Extracted constants and reduced magic numbers
- Cleaner signal handling and threading logic
- Improved UI component organization

Both modules now follow SOLID principles, have better testability, improved maintainability, and cleaner code structure.


[2025-06-26 16:51:00] - Application successfully running after refactoring: Confirmed that run.py launches correctly and the refactored prompt editor and floating toolbar modules are working properly. All refactoring improvements are now operational.
