## Project Status Post-Refactoring (2025-05-15)

The LifAi project has undergone a significant refactoring. All core components have been updated for performance, modernization, and stability.

- **Prompt Editor:** Fully refactored with JSON storage and UUIDs; bugs addressed.
- **AI Clients:** Modernized with `async/await` and `httpx`.
- **Knowledge Base:** Optimized, potentially using `aiofiles` for async operations.
- **UI Components:** Reviewed and updated for performance.
- **Documentation:** Code comments and [`README.md`](README.md) are up-to-date. Memory bank update is the current task.
- **Removed Modules:** The previously removed modules (AI Chat, Advanced Agent) remain deprecated, with their functionalities either superseded or integrated into the refactored system where appropriate.
