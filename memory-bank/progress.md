## Project Status Post-Refactoring (2025-05-15)

The LifAi project has undergone a significant refactoring. All core components have been updated for performance, modernization, and stability.

- **Prompt Editor:** Fully refactored with JSON storage and UUIDs; bugs addressed.
- **AI Clients:** Modernized with `async/await` and `httpx`.
- **Knowledge Base:** Optimized, potentially using `aiofiles` for async operations.
- **UI Components:** Reviewed and updated for performance.
- **Documentation:** Code comments and [`README.md`](README.md) are up-to-date. Memory bank update is the current task.
- **Removed Modules:** The previously removed modules (AI Chat, Advanced Agent) remain deprecated, with their functionalities either superseded or integrated into the refactored system where appropriate.

[2025-06-25 11:24:00] - Added user-specific configuration files to .gitignore: app_settings.json and prompts.json to prevent committing user preferences and custom prompts.

[2025-06-25 11:42:00] - Major AI client refactoring completed: Enhanced LM Studio and Ollama clients with latest API features including TTL support, new embedding endpoints, improved streaming, better model management, and comprehensive error handling.

[2025-06-25 12:40:00] - Added user-friendly prompt flow illustration feature: Question mark help button next to backend selection that explains how system prompts and user text are processed for both Ollama and LM Studio with visual flow diagrams.

[2025-06-25 12:42:00] - Fixed async initialization error in OllamaClient: Removed asyncio.create_task() from __init__ method to prevent "no running event loop" runtime error during application startup.

[2025-06-25 12:53:00] - Optimized LM Studio client for native API v0: Switched default to /api/v0/ endpoints, added default TTL (600s), enhanced performance tracking with detailed metrics, and updated help dialog to highlight native API benefits.

[2025-06-25 13:58:00] - Fixed UI display issues in help dialog: Centered question mark button text with proper padding/margins, and completely redesigned help dialog using custom QDialog instead of QMessageBox to eliminate spacing gaps and provide better layout control with clean, professional appearance.


[2025-06-26 16:38:00] - Fixed Git tracking issue: Removed app_settings.json and prompts.json from Git tracking using 'git rm --cached' command. These files were already in .gitignore but continued showing in VSCode changes because they were previously tracked. Files are now properly ignored.


[2025-06-26 16:41:00] - Enhanced prompt backup system: Implemented automatic backup rotation in prompt editor that maintains only the 5 most recent backup files (.bak). Added _cleanup_old_backups() method to automatically remove older backups when saving, preventing unlimited accumulation of backup files.


[2025-06-26 16:48:00] - Major code refactoring completed: Refactored both prompt editor and floating toolbar modules for best practices and improved maintainability. Key improvements include:

**Prompt Editor Refactoring:**
- Separated concerns into dedicated classes: PromptStorageManager, PromptValidator, EmojiManager
- Added dataclasses and type hints throughout
- Improved error handling and validation
- Better code organization with private methods
- Constants extracted to module level
- Enhanced backup rotation system integration

**Floating Toolbar Refactoring:**
- Implemented proper separation of concerns with dedicated managers: PromptManager, ColorManager, TextFilter, MouseSelectionHandler
- Added enum for processing states and dataclass for UI styles
- Improved type hints and error handling throughout
- Better architecture with composition over inheritance
- Extracted constants and reduced magic numbers
- Cleaner signal handling and threading logic
- Improved UI component organization

Both modules now follow SOLID principles, have better testability, improved maintainability, and cleaner code structure.


[2025-06-26 16:51:00] - Application successfully running after refactoring: Confirmed that run.py launches correctly and the refactored prompt editor and floating toolbar modules are working properly. All refactoring improvements are now operational.


[2025-06-26 16:58:00] - Added console-free launch options: Created run.pyw file and launch.bat for running the application without showing the command prompt window. Updated README.md with three launch options: console-free (recommended), batch file, and with console (for debugging). Users can now double-click run.pyw or launch.bat for a clean desktop experience.


[2025-06-26 17:01:00] - Fixed launch.bat and finalized launch options: Updated launch.bat to use pythonw.exe with better error handling and fallback options. Confirmed that run.pyw works perfectly for console-free launching. Updated README.md to prioritize run.pyw as the recommended launch method, with launch.bat as optional alternative. Users now have reliable console-free application launching.


[2025-06-26 17:02:00] - Finalized console-free launch solution: Removed problematic launch.bat file due to PATH issues. Simplified to focus on working solution: run.pyw provides reliable console-free launching via double-click. Updated README.md with clean, simple instructions emphasizing run.pyw as the primary method with pythonw command as backup option.


[2025-06-27 14:16:00] - Added custom temperature settings for AI prompts: Enhanced prompt editor with temperature control (0.0-2.0) for each system prompt. Updated both Ollama and LM Studio clients to use per-prompt temperature settings. Users can now fine-tune AI creativity/randomness individually for each prompt template via intuitive spinbox control in prompt editor UI.


[2025-06-27 14:31:00] - Updated README.md to reflect current project state: Comprehensively revised README to showcase latest features including custom temperature controls, advanced AI client integrations, async architecture modernization, and enhanced prompt management. Updated sections include improved feature descriptions, current requirements, detailed usage guide with temperature recommendations, modern architecture overview, and acknowledgment of recent enhancements.


[2025-01-07 15:14:00] - Modernized reasoning token handling: Deprecated legacy <thinking> regex filtering in favor of native reasoning token support from Ollama and LM Studio. Updated both AI clients to support the 'think' parameter for reasoning models. Enhanced floating toolbar to detect and use native thinking separation when available, falling back to legacy filtering only when needed. This improves performance and accuracy by leveraging native API features instead of post-processing regex.


[2025-08-25 22:32:00] - Major AI Client Refactoring with Context7 Optimizations: Successfully completed comprehensive enhancement of both Ollama and LM Studio clients using latest Context7 documentation findings for optimal inference speed and performance.
